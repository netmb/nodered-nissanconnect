# nodered-nissanconnect

Here are three NodeRed-Subflows that can be used to connect to the NissanConnect-Service (only the "new" Service, > Mid 2019).
The subflows basically contains all the stuff from dartnissanconnect.

The Demo-Flow shows how to use the Nodes. Dont forget to edit the MQTT-Node in the Status-Subflow. Also dont forget to edit the config-parameters (user, pass and timezone).
